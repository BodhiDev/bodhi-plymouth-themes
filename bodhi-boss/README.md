# Bodhi Boss

The 'Bodhi Boss' theme is tailored for use with Plymouth, a boot splash utility for Linux, and was initially created for Bodhi Linux. However, it can be utilized on any distribution that employs Plymouth. Derived from the many Plymouth themes that utilize Mad Nick's Plymouth script. 

Refactored to meet my coding style and to address this [Launchpad issue](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-release-notes/+bug/1944519) making it unsuitable for use in an ISO.

Bodhi Boss is the default plymouth theme for Bodhi Linux 7.0.
