# bodhi-plymouth themes

A collection of plymouth themes for use with Bodhi Linux. In time we will add most if not all our old plymouth themes as well as a few exciting new themes.

# Contributing

We welcome contributions from graphic artists who are knowledgeable in Plymouth scripts. It is essential that any artwork included is suitably licensed and fully credited to the artist or photographer. If you require further information or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. All themes submitted should be GPL version 3 or latter.

Thanks in advance.
